<h1>Kiya Jones</h1> 
<!-- <h1 class='name'>My Name</h1> would work and allow you customize it in css without have to use !important
as would using an id. <div id="heading"></div> would not work when trying to style in css because the heading 
is not being specifically targeted so you would have to use !important and the end of every customization like 
you would when only using the tags and not a class or id in html.  -->
