      <div>
        <!-- should probably go back and change the h1 tag and first p tag to classes or ids. since the navbar is 
        a bootstrap template, it requires you to add '!important' at the end of certain css rules to override bootstrap.
      if they have a class or id name, the '!important' is not required/necessary to make sure the css rules you applied
    are working correctly. -->
<h1>Kiya Jones</h1> 
<!-- <h1 class='name'>My Name</h1> would work and allow you customize it in css without have to use !important
as would using an id. <div id="heading"></div> would not work when trying to style in css because the heading 
is not being specifically targeted so you would have to use !important and the end of every customization like 
you would when only using the tags and not a class or id in html.  -->

<!-- giving paragraphs an id or class names makes it easier to go back and style them in css. using the paragraph tag 
only makes sense if you want every paragraph to have the same exact styling. you won't be able to have different styling
for each because they will all only belong to one tag so that is why you want to give different paragraps their own class
or id name. -->
