        a bootstrap template, it requires you to add '!important' at the end of certain css rules to override bootstrap.
      if they have a class or id name, the '!important' is not required/necessary to make sure the css rules you applied
    are working correctly. -->
<h1>Kiya Jones</h1> 
<!-- <h1 class='name'>My Name</h1> would work and allow you customize it in css without have to use !important
as would using an id. <div id="heading"></div> would not work when trying to style in css because the heading 
is not being specifically targeted so you would have to use !important and the end of every customization like 
you would when only using the tags and not a class or id in html.  -->

<!-- giving paragraphs an id or class names makes it easier to go back and style them in css. using the paragraph tag 
only makes sense if you want every paragraph to have the same exact styling. you won't be able to have different styling
for each because they will all only belong to one tag so that is why you want to give different paragraphs their own class
or id name. -->

<!-- when putting the h2 and p ids into a parent container, flexbox isn't centering correctly and causes the about me id
to move up to the top of the page and instead of just centering along -->

<h2 class="heading">about me </h2>

<p class="about-me">Hello! My name is Kiya. I am currently enrolled in the Eleven Fifty Academy part-time Web Development course. Currently, I have moderate experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, as well as Bootstrap. I have been curious about coding 
  for several years now, and dabbled lightly with HTML and CSS, but was never able to fully grasp or get too deep into either of them.
After doing a bit of research and homework looking into coding and Web Development, I decided that it was time to make way over into a career change
by doing something that is highly in demand sought after, as well as something that I take a big interest in and am highly intrigued by.
I'm hoping that I can continue to learn things and expand my knowledge in other coding languages and things related to coding , programming,
 developing. I also that sometime in the near future I can consider myself a Web Developer or Designer. </p>
